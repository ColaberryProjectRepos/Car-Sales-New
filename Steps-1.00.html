font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The alarming rise in car sales is
contributing to a pressing environmental concern, as evidenced by the projected
statistics. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global fuel
consumption for road transportation is expected to reach <span style="color:red">1.7 billion metric tons </span>of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by
2040, reflecting a significant increase from the <span style="color:red">1.3
billion Mtoe </span>consumed in 2019. This surge in fuel consumption is
directly linked to the growing number of cars on the road, leading to the
depletion of finite fossil fuel reserves and exacerbating environmental
degradation caused by extraction and transportation processes.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
