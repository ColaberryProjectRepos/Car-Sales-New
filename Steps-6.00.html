&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">1)In February 2012, car sales were <span style="color:#00B050">$32K</span>, but in March 2012, the sales price <span style="color:#C00000">decreased </span>by <span style="color:#C00000">$8K </span>to
$24K compared to the previous month. I suggest Analyzing the reasons for the
decrease: Investigate the factors contributing to the decline in car sales.
Look for potential causes such as economic conditions, market trends,
competitor actions, or changes in consumer preferences. Understanding the
underlying causes will help develop appropriate strategies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mercedes-B <span style="color:red">(-10%</span>), and Saturn<span style="color:red">(-16%), </span>These manufacturers have negative YoY price
percentages, indicating a decrease in prices compared to the previous year.
This price decline may reflect market challenges, changes in consumer
preferences, or intensified competition, which could impact the perceived value
and profitability of their vehicles.</span> My suggestion is <span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">value
proposition: Evaluate vehicles' value proposition in relation to the market and
competitors. Identify the unique selling points that differentiate your
vehicles from others and highlight them in your marketing and sales efforts.
Emphasize the quality, performance, features, and after-sales services that set
your brand apart and effectively communicate the value customers can expect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">3)</span> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
107%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The average price of the "Car -
Latest Model" <span style="color:red">($26K</span>) is lower than the
average price of the "Passenger - Old Model" ($29K). This suggests
that the latest model of the car has a <span style="color:red">lower price </span>than
the older model of the passenger vehicle. This price difference may indicate
that the car's latest model is less expensive or offers less value compared to
the older model of the passenger vehicle. This could impact the perceived value
and competitiveness of the car's latest model. I suggest Highlight Unique
Selling Points: Identify and emphasize the unique selling points and advantages
of the latest car model. Communicate these differentiators through marketing
and advertising campaigns to raise awareness and enhance their perceived value.
Highlight aspects such as fuel efficiency, safety features, advanced
technology, or other distinguishing factors that set it apart from the older
model and other vehicles in its segment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to <span style="color:#C00000">21k</span> compared to the previous month. I
suggest Strengthen Partnerships: Collaborate with dealerships or partners to
expand your reach and tap into new customer segments. Joint marketing efforts,
cooperative advertising, or co-branded promotions can increase visibility and
attract potential customers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
